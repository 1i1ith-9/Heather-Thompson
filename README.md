# My Portfolio
My skills are mostly in meatspace right now, but when my coding skills develop, that will change...
## About Me
I am a (self-taught beginner) surfer, Jiu-Jitsu white-belt, bartender and book-editor learning the basics of coding through online courses. When I am not working or doing sports, I enjoy spending time with my cat Sassafrass and watching movies on my projector.
